Description: This project creates a Javascript solution to Possible trains tracks problem.

To compile the CSS and Js from app folder into static folder:

```npm run build:css```
```npm run build:js```

TODO LIST:
- [ ] to integrate front-end and core module solution;
- [ ] to write tests;
- [ ] to apply js compression and minification tool;
- [ ] to apply css minification tool;

I'm using Babel to write Javascript using the most current syntax and features and using LESS and RSCSS to write a modern and structured CSS.

For write the tests I would to use Jasmine or Mocha with Shay.
For Javascript minification and compression I would to use Uglify
